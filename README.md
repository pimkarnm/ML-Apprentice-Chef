# Machine Learning with the Apprentice Chef case

Apprentice Chef, Inc. is an innovative company with a unique spin on cooking at home. Developed for the busy professional that 
has little to no skills in the kitchen, the company offers a wide selection of daily-prepared gourmet meals delivered 
directly to customers' doors. Each meal set takes at most 30 minutes to finish cooking at home and also comes with Apprentice Chef's award-winning
disposable cookware (i.e. pots, pans, baking trays, and utensils), allowing for fast and easy
cleanup. Ordering meals is very easy given the user-friendly online platform and mobile app.

**Part I - Regression Model Development**

After three years serving customers across the San Francisco Bay Area, the executives at
Apprentice Chef have decided to take on an analytics project to better understand how much
revenue to expect from each customer within their first year of using their services. 

Assigned Tasks:

- Analyzing data
- Developing top insights
- Building a machine learning model to predict revenue over the first year of each customer’s life cycle

Project scopes:

- Not interested in a time series analysis
- “Keep things simple” by providing a dataset of aggregated customer information

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Part II - Classification Model Development**

In an effort to diversify the revenue stream, Apprentice Chef, Inc. has launched Halfway There,
a cross-selling promotion where subscribers receive a half bottle of wine from a local California
vineyard every Wednesday (halfway through the work week). The executives at Apprentice Chef
also believe this endeavor will create a competitive advantage based on its unique product
offering of hard to find local wines from smaller vineyards.

Halfway There has been exclusively offered to all of the customers in the dataset,
and the executives would like to promote this service to a wider audience.

Assigned Tasks:

- Analyzing data
- Developing top insights
- Building a machine learning model to predict which customers will subscribe to this service.

**Part III - Analysis Report to Management**

Based on the case provided, develop a consolidated report containing the top actionable insights from the case as well as the final revenue and cross-sell promotion models.

Target Audience: C-Suite executives (a non-technical audience)

The target audience has a basic understanding of:

- Correlation (understands the basic concept)
- OLS regression and logistic regression (they once built base models in Excel while enrolled in business school, but that was several years ago)

Also, the target audience have never seen the data and do not understand what the column labels in the dataset mean. 
The audience is more interested in the actionable insights as opposed to the steps that were taken to achieve the results.
